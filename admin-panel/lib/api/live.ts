/**
 * Live admin API client for the FastAPI backend.
 *
 * Base URL: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (no trailing slash). All routes below are relative to it.
 *
 * Sign-in (lib/auth/sign-in.ts; no bearer token, same error format)
 *   POST   /auth/google   body { credential: <Google ID token from Google Identity Services>, app: "admin" }
 *   POST   /dev/token     body { email, name, app: "admin" }   (local development backend only)
 *          → { token, expires_at (ISO 8601), email (lowercased), name }
 *          401 bad credential, 403 not an organiser. Admin tokens last 12 hours; there is no refresh.
 *
 * Conventions
 * - Every admin request sends `Authorization: Bearer <session token>` from the sign-in response.
 *   Admin endpoints reject student portal tokens. 401 (missing or expired token) signs the panel
 *   out and returns to /login; 403 from /admin/me shows the "not authorised" screen.
 * - Requests time out after 20 seconds.
 * - Request and response bodies use snake_case keys; this client converts them to and from camelCase.
 *   Query parameter names are snake_case too. Enum values (statuses, sort keys) are sent as-is.
 * - Errors are non-2xx responses with `{ "detail": "Human readable message" }`; `detail` is always a
 *   string, including for 422 (the client still copes with FastAPI's list form just in case).
 *   401 = missing or expired token, 403 = not an admin / outside the admin's scope / super admin only,
 *   404 = not found, 409 = state conflict (e.g. already withdrawn, results already published),
 *   422 = invalid input.
 * - Role scoping, enforced by the backend: role "admin" sees only KIET teams whose `department`
 *   equals the admin's department, KIET students whose own `department` equals it, audit entries
 *   whose `department` equals it, and only that department's finalist board. Passing any other
 *   `department` returns 403, as does opening another department's team by ID.
 *   Role "super_admin" sees everything (all departments, other colleges and schools).
 * - Paged responses: `{ items, total, page, page_size }`. `page` starts at 1; `page_size` defaults
 *   to 25, max 100.
 *
 * Endpoints (request → response; shapes are the types in lib/admin-types.ts and lib/types.ts)
 *
 *   GET    /admin/me
 *          → AdminUser { email, name, role: "super_admin" | "admin", department | null, added_at, added_by }
 *          403 if the signed-in email is not an admin.
 *
 *   GET    /admin/stats
 *          → Stats (scoped to the caller). `by_type` and `by_department` are null for department admins.
 *
 *   GET    /admin/teams?department=&category=&status=&type=&route=&q=&sort=&order=&page=&page_size=
 *          department: KIET department name (e.g. "CSE(AI)"); category: 1-8;

 *
 *   GET    /admin/students?department=&type=&year=&in_team=&q=&sort=&order=&page=&page_size=
 *          in_team: yes | no; q (at most 100 characters) matches name, email, roll number, institution, phone;
 *          sort: name | email | department | year | institution | created_at (default name).
 *          → Page<AdminStudent> (Profile + team { id, code, name, status, department, role } | null)
 *
 *   GET    /admin/students/export?(same filters, no paging)
 *          → AdminStudent[]

 *
 *   POST   /admin/schedule/open-now     (super_admin only)    body {} or { registration_closes }
 *          Opens registration now. 409 if already open; 422 if the (old or given) closing date is not in the future,
 *          in which case send a new registration_closes. → Schedule
 *
 *   POST   /admin/schedule/close-now    (super_admin only)
 *          Closes registration now; submitted teams are untouched. 409 if already closed. → Schedule
 *
 *   GET    /admin/finalists?department=
 *          → FinalistBoard { department, published_at, updated_at, updated_by,
 *            categories: [{ category, quota, teams: TeamSummary[], nominated: team_id[] }] }
 *          One entry per category 1-8. `teams` = submitted, route "department" teams of that

 *          body { nominations: [{ category, team_ids: string[] }] }  (categories not listed are unchanged)

 *
 *   POST   /admin/results/publish          (super_admin only, once)   body { confirm: "PUBLISH" }
 *          422 without the phrase; 409 before the nominations deadline or when nobody is nominated (the reason is
 *          also in GET /admin/finalists/summary as publish_blocked)
 *          Every submitted route "department" team becomes result "finalist" if nominated, else
 *          "not_selected". Finale-route teams are unchanged. Locks nominations. 409 if already published.
 *          → PublishResult { published_at, finalists, not_selected }

 *          (same institution, category eligibility, 1-5 members or 2-5 to submit, unique name); the leader must be in the
 *          caller's scope. → AdminTeam (201)
 *
 *   POST   /admin/teams/{id}/reopen    (super_admin) body { reason } → AdminTeam (draft). 409 unless submitted and registration is
