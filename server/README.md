# InnoTech'26 API

FastAPI backend for the student portal (`client/`) and the admin panel (`admin-panel/`).
PostgreSQL for data (in Docker on the same EC2 instance), Google sign-in verified by this API, Amazon SES for emails.

## Run it locally

Needs Python 3.12 and a local PostgreSQL.

```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
createdb innotech_dev && createdb innotech_test
cp .env.development.example .env          # local settings, never used in production
.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head            # create the tables
.venv/bin/python -m app.dev_seed          # optional: demo students, a team and demo admins
.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # http://localhost:8000, docs at /docs
```

Tests run against the `innotech_test` database (override with `TEST_DATABASE_URL`):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
.venv/bin/ruff check app tests && .venv/bin/ruff format --check app tests
```

### Frontends against the local API

Without Google, both frontends can sign in through `POST /dev/token`. That endpoint exists only when
`ENVIRONMENT=development` and `DEV_SIGN_IN=true`. Create a
`.env.local` in `client/` (and in `admin-panel/`):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MODE=live
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SIGN_IN=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORCE_REGISTRATION_OPEN=true   # client only, while testing before 3 October
```

The demo accounts on each login page match `app/dev_seed.py`; `superadmin@kiet.edu` is the super
admin from `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` in `.env.development.example`.

## Deploying

Everything is in [`deploy/`](../deploy): one CloudFormation stack (EC2 t4g.medium running Caddy, this API and
PostgreSQL in Docker; the two static sites on S3 + CloudFront; daily disk snapshots; 15-minute database dumps to S3),
and `deploy/deploy.sh` to roll out releases. Copy `deploy/production.env.example` to `deploy/production.env`, then
`./deploy.sh stack`, `./deploy.sh api`, `./deploy.sh sites`.

The app **refuses to start** in production if `DEV_SIGN_IN` or `FORCE_REGISTRATION_OPEN` is set, if `SESSION_SECRET` is
shorter than 32 characters, if `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS` is empty, if `CORS_ORIGINS` contains `*`, or if `EMAIL_BACKEND` is not
set explicitly.

### Sign-in

- The frontends show Google's "Sign in with Google" button (Google Identity Services) and post the Google ID token to
  `POST /auth/google` with `app` = `portal` or `admin`. The API checks Google's signature, the audience (one of
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS`), expiry and `email_verified`, and returns its own session token
  (`{token, expires_at, email, name}`): 7 days for the portal, 12 hours for the admin panel. Admin tokens are issued only
  to organisers, and portal tokens are rejected by admin endpoints.
- `@kiet.edu` accounts must carry Google Workspace's `hd=kiet.edu` claim, so a personal Google account registered with a
  KIET address cannot pose as a student.
- Google Cloud Console: OAuth consent screen *External* and *In production* (the scopes `openid email profile` need no
  verification); an OAuth client of type *Web application* whose *Authorised JavaScript origins* are the portal and admin
  origins (plus `http://localhost:3000` and `:3001` for local testing). No redirect URIs are needed.

### Other pieces

- **SES**: `EMAIL_BACKEND=ses`, a verified sender identity and SES production access. Emails are sent after the request
  commits; a failed email is logged and never fails the action.
- **Rate limiting**: invitations per team per day, and join-code attempts per student (stored in PostgreSQL, shared by
  all workers). Caddy caps request bodies at 1 MB.
- **Admins**: people in `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` are always super admins and add department admins in the admin panel.

## How it works

```
app/
  main.py          app setup: CORS, security headers, error format, routers, /health
  config.py        settings from environment variables, with production safety checks
  auth.py          Google ID token verification, session tokens, current student / admin
  rules.py         registration rules (mirrors client/lib/rules.ts)
  models.py        tables and constraints
  schemas.py       request validation and response shapes
  services/        students.py (profile, teams, invitations), admin.py, serializers, audit, limits (rate limits)
  routers/         auth.py (sign-in), students.py, admin.py, dev.py (development only)
  emails.py        SES notifications
migrations/        Alembic
tests/             pytest, against PostgreSQL
```

Errors always return `{"detail": "<message for the user>"}`: 401 not signed in, 403 not allowed or registration
closed, 404 not found (also for other people's teams), 409 conflict (e.g. team locked), 422 invalid input,
429 too many invitations.

**Rules enforced on the server** include: `@kiet.edu` accounts register only as KIET and other accounts only as other
college or school; teams of 2 to 5 from the same college or school; one team per student; school teams only in
Categories 5 and 7; Category 6 only for first-years; the registration window; teams locked after submission;
college, department and year locked while in a team; one pending invitation per student per team; unique team
names and KIET roll numbers; finalist quotas per department; department admins limited to their department.

**Concurrent requests**: every change to a team locks the team row (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), and unique constraints
back up the cross-team rules (one team per student, unique names), so double clicks and simultaneous actions by
teammates cannot break the rules. `tests/test_concurrency.py` fires such races in parallel against PostgreSQL.

### Endpoints

Sign-in: `POST /auth/google` (and `POST /dev/token` in development).

Student portal (`client/lib/api/live.ts`): `GET /me` (includes the registration window the server enforces), `PUT /me/profile`, `GET /me/team`, `GET /me/invitations`,
`POST /teams`, `POST /teams/join`, `POST /teams/{id}/join-code/reset`, `PATCH /teams/{id}`, `DELETE /teams/{id}`, `POST /teams/{id}/submit`, `POST /teams/{id}/leave`,
`DELETE /teams/{id}/members/{user_id}`, `POST /teams/{id}/invitations`, `DELETE /invitations/{id}`,
`POST /invitations/{id}/accept`, `POST /invitations/{id}/decline`.

Admin panel (`admin-panel/lib/api/live.ts`, which documents scoping and errors in detail): `GET /admin/me`,
`GET /admin/stats`, `GET /admin/teams`, `GET /admin/teams/export`, `GET /admin/teams/{id}`,
`POST /admin/teams/{id}/withdraw|disqualify|restore`, `GET /admin/students`, `GET /admin/students/export`,
`GET /admin/finalists`, `PUT /admin/finalists/{department}`, `GET /admin/finalists/summary`,
`POST /admin/results/publish`, `GET|POST /admin/admins`, `DELETE /admin/admins/{email}`, `GET /admin/audit`.
